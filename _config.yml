# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I am a university student working toward a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. As a creative person who has always been around computers, programming always interested me. Since then, I have been successful in my studies, achieving highest standing in two of my courses, and learned a lot in my personal projects, the most complete one being my Data Structure "Diagrammer" built with the Java standard library. The more I build software, the more convinced I am it is my passion, what I am made to do, and the perfect career for me. My objective is to apply and further develop my skills as a software developer, and build technologies that are useful and productive.
